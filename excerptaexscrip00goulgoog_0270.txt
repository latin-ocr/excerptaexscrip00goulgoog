Casan. Julius Cesar was one of the most celebrated of the Ro·
man emperors, and from him the name of Cesar was transmitted to the
subsequent emperors. Endowed with extraordinary talenta, and influ-

was, however, of short continuance. A conspiracy was formed against
him, with Brutus aud Cassius at its head3 and he was assassinated in
the senate-house, on the Ides of March, forty·four years before the
Christian era. Soon after his death, a new star, or rather comet, was
