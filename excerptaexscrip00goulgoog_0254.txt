Carrinas. Alier the death of Achilles, the arms, which Vulcan
had, iven him, were claimed by Ajax and Ulysses, two of the Grecian
chieis. Ajar, the son of Telamon, a king of the island of Salamis,
was distinguished samuch by his rashness and impetuosity, aab his
invincible brevery. Ulysses, the son of Laertes, end king of 1 ca,
was less valiant in war than his rival ; but he manifested greater
eloquence 'aad wisdom in council, and rendered more essential assist-
ance to the Greeks by his advice, than Ajax by his arms. In the
contentiou between these heroes, Ovid has accurately delineated their
characters. The speech of the son of Telamon evinces the honest

bluntnoss of the soldier 3 while in the reply of Ulysses, we perceive
the insinuating and artful address of the orator.

aster he was born, his mother plunged him into the river Styx; end
thus made him invulnerable in every part except the beel by which
she held him. This precaution was not, however, sufficient to divest
her of her fears for his future sofety ; and when the Grecian armies
